Weather app using Riverpod this Async Value to check weather 
and make animation with depends conditions.

## Architecture

This application uses a layered architecture, using the example of the Black package, only we use Roverpad:
1. Presentation
2. State
3. Domain
4. Data

## Animations
To make the application more interesting,
we have added animations depending on weather conditions.
